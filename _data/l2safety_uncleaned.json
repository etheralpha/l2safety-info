STARKs proofs are wrapped in SNARKs proofs for efficiency. SNARKs require a trusted setup.","score":3},"data_availability":{"status":"Data Availability","color":"danger","note":"External: Proof construction and state derivation rely fully on data that is NOT published onchain.","score":1},"exit_window":{"status":"Exit Window","color":"danger","note":"None: There is no window for users to exit in case of an unwanted standard upgrade because the central operator can censor withdrawal transactions by implementing a TransactionFilterer with no delay. The standard upgrade delay is 4d 21h.","score":1},"sequencer_failure":{"status":"Sequencer Failure","color":"danger","note":"No mechanism: There is no mechanism to have transactions be included if the sequencer is down or censoring. The Operator actively uses a TransactionFilterer contract, which requires accounts that enqueue or force transactions from L1 to be whitelisted.","score":1},"proposer_failure":{"status":"Proposer Failure","color":"warning","note":"Cannot withdraw: Only the whitelisted proposers can publish state roots on L1, so in the event of failure the withdrawals are frozen. There is a decentralized Governance system that can attempt changing Proposers with an upgrade.","score":2},"tvl":{"val":0,"val_total":0,"str":"$0","str_total":"$0","color":"danger"},"checkmarks":1,"score":8}]}
